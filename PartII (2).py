Assignment 2 Part II.  ISA Hierarchy Manipulation

'''
# Linneus3b.py
# Implements storage and inference on an ISA hierarchy
# This Python program goes with the book "The Elements of Artificial
# Intelligence".
# This version runs under Python 3.x.

# Steven Tanimoto
# (C) 2012. updated 2017 to use Python's defaultdict class.

# The ISA relation is represented using a dictionary, ISA.
# There is a corresponding inverse dictionary, INCLUDES.
# Each entry in the ISA dictionary is of the form
#  ('turtle' : ['reptile', 'shelled-creature'])

# This version includes a testing option to help during development
# of the special feature required in Assignment 2 of CSE 415 during
# Autumn Quarter, 2017 at the University of Washington.
# The test option was implemented by Connor Schenck.
